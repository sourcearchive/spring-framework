/**
 * <p>This class extends AbstractJpaTests,
 * one of the valuable test superclasses provided in the org.springframework.test
 * package. This represents best practice for integration tests with Spring. 
 * The AbstractTransactionalDataSourceSpringContextTests superclass provides the
 * following services:
 * <li>Injects test dependencies, meaning that we don't need to perform application
 * context lookups. See the setClinic() method. Injection uses autowiring by type.
 * <li>Executes each test method in its own transaction, which is automatically
 * rolled back by default. This means that even if tests insert or otherwise
 * change database state, there is no need for a teardown or cleanup script.
 * <li>Provides useful inherited protected fields, such as a JdbcTemplate that can be
 * used to verify database state after test operations, or verify the results of queries
 * performed by application code. An ApplicationContext is also inherited, and can be
 * used for explicit lookup if necessary.
 *
 * <p>The AbstractTransactionalDataSourceSpringContextTests and related classes are shipped
 * in the spring-mock.jar.
