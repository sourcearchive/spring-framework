/**
 * Callback interface for JPA code. To be used with JpaTemplate's execute
 * method, assumably often as anonymous classes within a method implementation.
 * The typical implementation will call EntityManager CRUD to perform
 * some operations on persistent objects.
 *
 * <p>Note that JPA works on bytecode-modified Java objects, to be able to
 * perform dirty detection on each modification of a persistent instance field.
 * In contrast to Hibernate, using returned objects outside of an active
 * EntityManager poses a problem: To be able to read and modify fields
 * e.g. in a web GUI, one has to explicitly make the instances "transient".
 * Reassociation with a new EntityManager, e.g. for updates when coming
 * back from the GUI, isn't possible, as the JPA instances have lost their
 * identity when turned transient. This means that either value objects have
 * to be used as parameters, or the contents of the outside-modified instance
 * have to be copied to a freshly loaded active instance on reassociation.
